# Velocity Proxy for Simple Voice Chat

This project allows you to run multiple servers with Simple Voice Chat behind a Velocity proxy all while using only a single public UDP port! You don't need to expose every server individually anymore as the Voice will be proxied through Velocity.


## This project has been adopted into the official Simple Voice Chat project!

I am very happy to announce that, in collaboration with henkelmax, **Velocity proxy support has been officially adopted** by the Simple Voice Chat project in [this Pull Request](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat/pull/674).

Beta Builds are available in their Discord server and are coming to Modrinth soon.

Simple Voice Chat was developed by https://github.com/henkelmax and is available at [Simple Voice Chat on GitHub](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat)
